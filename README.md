# Using Hypothesis Testing to Determine if Temperature Impacts Workout Performance

This repository contains a Juypter Notebook and the sample data I used to show that **hot temperatures have a statistically significant impact** while humid weather doesn't necessarily.

For a more in depth explanation of the experiments and the methodologies used, check out the medium article I wrote: [click here](https://medium.com/@matthewghannoum/58cc70178dc2).

## Requirements

To run this notebook, Python 3.10.3 (or a compatible version with it) is required as well as the following packages:

- [plotly](https://pypi.org/project/plotly/)
- [statsmodels](https://pypi.org/project/statsmodels/)
- [scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/)
